        <h1 class="lead" id="description_lead">In the last 50 years since the dawn of the era of information, innovators have continued to perfect the design of modern computers.</h1>

        <p class="desc" id="description"> Not too long ago, computers were the size of an entire room and could barely add two numbers together. Not only have new developments in technology saved time, they have also been able to save lives. People might wonder, “Where do we go from here?”
            Just as our modern computers can do hundreds of millions of times more operations than the older server rooms and bulky wires, computers in the next few decades will be able to transform the world into a futuristic utopia.

            <p class="desc" id="second-description"> As time passes and more people join the computer and technology industries, there will be drastic changes in the way we interact with the environment, the way we get work done, the ways in which we can manipulate a computer program, the ways
                in which we can be entertained by video games, and the ways in which we can make sure everyone in the world will be able to participate in these activities with us.</p>

                    and, naturally, I was drawn to the idea of writing a magazine about technology. When I’m not on my computer experimenting with all kinds of programs, I’m usually playing basketball or doing something crazy with my friends. NextGen
                    is an important project to me, as I love to explore the idea of new technologies and future innovations. However, technology has not been readily available for every person in the world, and unfortunately, people overlook the need
                    for accessible technology. My goal is to shed some light on that issue and promote groups who aim to solve that project. Through participating in the EZine course, I have learned more about the modern age of technology, and I have
                    also learned about how to convey information in the form of an article.</p>

                    most of my spare-time projects are focused on designing software, so I decided that the interfaces route would be the best one to take for this magazine. I feel like the user experience is an underrated aspect of software design, and
                    so I wanted to draw some attention to how much effort and thinking goes into making interfaces blend in so you don't notice them as much. My long-term dream is to be the owner of a tech company.</p>

                    to technology which greatly encouraged me to work on this tech magazine. I picked my topic of IoT for my article in this magazine because IoT is a big thing that is coming to our lives, and something I believe will be integrated into
                    everything around us. Unfortunately not a lot of people understand it, so I wrote this article to inform them all about this new and wonderful thing. Along with the arrival of IoT, I hope that in the future I am able achieve the dream
                    of being a successful business owner and be able to help the world in as many ways as possible.</p>
